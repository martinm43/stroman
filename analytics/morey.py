"""
Logistic functions that take differences
in calculated analytical values (Elo and SRS)
and returns a one-game probability of
winning.

def Elo_regress(dElo):
    """


    Parameters
    ----------
    dElo : difference in elo rating, defined as "home versus away".

    Returns
    -------
    the odds of the home team beating the away team.

    Define the binomial odds of the home team winning using the formula
    We = 1/(10^z+1)
    where We is the win expectancy
    and z is equal to -1*(delta+h)/F
    where F is a scaling factor for Elo
    and h is the home field advantage between two neutral teams.

    Solve for the cases where
    1) delta is zero, and home field advantage is some given % based on
    historical data
    2) delta is a large Elo difference, and the expected win percentage is high
    to obtain the coefficients that are used below.

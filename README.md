STROMAN

Named after the cocky Blue Jays pitcher, this is a rudimentary set 
of scripts based on the mlbgames api and other work I've done 
for NBA data analysis. 

The main creative work this builds upon as stated above is Carl Panzarino's
mlbgame, using the MLB license, located at https://github.com/panzarino/mlbgame/blob/master/LICENSE

(c) of some kind - TBD - Martin Miller

TBD:

Update pitching data in table
Report the 'analytics' along with conventional wins in a table
Playoff stuff - odds, etc. (This is probably a Canada Day Weekend type project at the earliest).

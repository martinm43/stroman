STROMAN

Named after the cocky Blue Jays pitcher, this is a rudimentary set 
of scripts based on the mlbgames api and other work I've done 
for NBA data analysis. 

The main creative work this builds upon as stated above is Carl Panzarino's
mlbgame, using the MLB license, located at https://github.com/panzarino/mlbgame/blob/master/LICENSE

(c) of some kind - TBD - Martin Miller

TBD:

Store ratings in a table.
RQ INT: Update pitching data (starting with pitcher names) in table
Report the 'analytics' along with conventional wins in a table
Playoff stuff - odds, etc. (This is probably a Canada Day Weekend type project at the earliest).
RQ INT: Parse the "unable to find data for..." statements and update the Games table to say "Game Postphoned"

STROMAN

Named after the cocky Blue Jays pitcher, this is a rudimentary set 
of scripts based on the mlbgames api and other work I've done 
for NBA data analysis. 

The main creative work this builds upon as stated above is Carl Panzarino's
mlbgame, using the MLB license, located at https://github.com/panzarino/mlbgame/blob/master/LICENSE

(c) of some kind - TBD - Martin Miller

TBD soon, RQ INT means requires internet, a lot of these are just raw ideas:

RQ INT: Parse the "unable to find data for..." statements and update the Games table to say "Game Postphoned"
RQ INT: Update pitching data (starting with pitcher names) in table

Report the 'analytics' along with conventional wins in a table
Use tables instead of prose for the run differentials
Sort run differentials
add expt win to run differential table by creating a single table
group teams by league, and then by divisions
add in some sort of "random quote" to the log file as a tail

TBD later:
Playoff predictions and the like should start no earlier than 20%, no later than 25% into season

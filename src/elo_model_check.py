"""
Script for determining on a yes-no basis whether the predicted elo_odds are accurate 
(i.e for how many times the home team has a winning percentage over 50% does the home team actually win)

Inputs: None
        start_year and end_year can be manually adjusted.
        Data is sourced from database.
        
Outputs: None
        Prints overall "success rate" to terminal.

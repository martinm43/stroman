S\+T\+R\+O\+M\+AN

Named after the cocky Blue Jays pitcher, this is a rudimentary set of scripts based on the mlbgames api and other work I\textquotesingle{}ve done for N\+BA data analysis.

The main creative work this builds upon as stated above is Carl Panzarino\textquotesingle{}s mlbgame, using the M\+LB license, located at \href{https://github.com/panzarino/mlbgame/blob/master/LICENSE}{\tt https\+://github.\+com/panzarino/mlbgame/blob/master/\+L\+I\+C\+E\+N\+SE}

Using an M\+IT license

Future Tasks\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Check monte carlo odds vs pythagorean projected wins (maybe in Python)
\item Need to harmonize the \char`\"{}division win percentages\char`\"{}
\item Modify C++ files to use argv and argc
\item Update pitching data (starting with pitcher names) in table.
\item Add a depository/list of \char`\"{}favourite baseball quotes\char`\"{} for program use.
\item G\+UI for updating missed/postphoned games, could be as easy as an Excel sheet/python script combination.
\item Can potentially update using G\+UI sqlitebrowser -\/ this will help with error checking
\end{DoxyItemize}

Ratings Calculation File (common to previous N\+BA work and current M\+LB work)\+: R1. analytics/burke\+\_\+solver.\+py Takes in a list of games (away team, away runs, home team, home runs) and calculates a functional equivalent of Simple Rating S\+Ystem (point differential adjusted for Strength of Schedule). Unlike the N\+BA equivalent there is no \char`\"{}cutoff\char`\"{}.

Filelist (to be updated) (linted save for C0103, variable names)\+:
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item full\+\_\+ratings\+\_\+calculations.\+py -\/ linted save for naming styles Calculates net ratings, Pythagorean win expectation, and adjusted net rating.
\item james.\+py -\/ linted save for naming styles Performes binomial regression based on run differential and adjusted net rating.
\item global\+\_\+update.\+py -\/ fully linted Updates multiple games (N days in the past via command line update)
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item mcss.\+py -\/ linted save for variable names Performs Monte Carlo simulation and calculates\+:
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item head to head records
\item league wins
\item division wins
\end{DoxyItemize}
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item mcss\+\_\+averages.\+py -\/ linted save for variable names Reads a dict of games to be played with their binomial win probabilities and produces an average number of wins for each team.
\item mlb\+\_\+array.\+py -\/ linted save for variable names Parses the attached xls schedule in order to create a season schedule and insert it into the database.
\item mlb\+\_\+data\+\_\+models.\+py -\/ linting is a tool, not a religious institution.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item not going to lint this file! Contains O\+RM models for the M\+LB database.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item supports.\+py -\/ linted save for variable names A set of assistant scripts for other main scripts in this library/repo/whatever. Contains scripts for calculating current ratings and the binomial win probabilities in future games. Also contains a function that converts the list of binomial win probabilities into a \char`\"{}head to head matrix\char`\"{}
\item table\+\_\+initializer.\+py -\/ linted Brief script that creates the tables in the M\+LB database.
\item tiebreaker.\+py -\/ linted save for variable names Function containing tiebreaker logic based on dicts containing team records and head to heads. Current time of development (may) is a bit too early to start thinking about tiebreaker logic for playoffs.
\item missing\+\_\+read.\+py -\/ linted save for variable names Reads missing games (games that have not yet been played) from an excel worksheet. Worksheet is a work in progress, development paused.
\item missing\+\_\+write.\+py -\/ linted save for variable names Writes missing games to excel worksheet (in progress). Note that there is the possibility that our update dates might be the reason for the win discrepancy. The goal here is not to track specific wins and losses at this point, but to assess team performance using raw stats.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

C/\+C++ Files Requires armadillo and sqlite3

Intention is to try and write some of the files (mcss, mcss\+\_\+averages, and full ratings calculations) in C++


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item \hyperlink{namespacemcss__average}{mcss\+\_\+average} Obtains known wins, then simulates the rest of the season 100,000 times and determines the average number of wins for the rest of the season. Teams are then sorted by division and total wins.
\item mcss Calculates the playoff odds using wildcard and head to head wins
\item \hyperlink{mcss_8h_source}{mcss.\+h} Header file containing necessary classes, functions, and structures
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

Compared to its similar file\+: \char`\"{}time python mcss\+\_\+average.\+py 10000\char`\"{} -\/ 1m 18.\+743s \char`\"{}time bash -\/c \char`\"{}./mcss\+\_\+average\char`\"{}\char`\"{} -\/ 7.\+267s, 11x faster.
